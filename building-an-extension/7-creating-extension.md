- You'll now see various files listed below the simulator. These are the source files of our new Extension;

</p>

- The main file we're interested in right now is the "main.ts" file. This will house the main source code of our new extension.
- Currently we've been given some really simple code in our "main.ts" file which just displays an icon;

</p>

- You'll notice that the extension for our files is ".ts", this denotes a "TypeScript" file, which is a Type Safe version of Javascript.
