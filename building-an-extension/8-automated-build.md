# Building an Extension #

MakeCode Extensions are compiled into a binary file which is then included in a project.

This compilation or build is carried out using a system called Travis CI, which is a Continuous Integration platform..

## Step 8 - Automated Build ##

- We're not going to worry too much about anything other than the 4th step - "Turn on your automated build on https://travis-ci.org".
- Go ahead and navigate to https://travis-ci.org;
