</p>

- Press the Download Button and, if everything has worked, the code should begin Downloading to our Physical Micro:Bit (The orange light on the Micro:Bit will rapidly flash during the download process).
- Once the download is complete and the code runs on the Micro:Bit, you should see that the Simulator has updated, and now shows an extra section - "Show Console Device";
